### Build Blockchain and Cryptocurrency from Scratch

I am interested in the blockchain technology that allows for the secure, distributed, decentralized storage of information.

This blockchain:
- Using object-oriented programming to make a block, blockchain and generates hashes.
- Unit Test Components and Blockchain.
- Peer-2-peer server ready to host the API for the Blockchain.
- Proof-of-work algorithm.
- Sign Transactions with cryptography and digital signature.
- Transaction Pool for a real-time list of incoming data.
- Include transactions in core blocks of the chain.

This project has helped me gain a greater understanding of the Blockchain and how it could be applied in the future, as an engineer living in a blockchain-dominated world.
